%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Especificaci√≥n:
\begin{frame}{Flux}{footnotes}
		Flux also includes custom footnote integration. For instance, this \textbf{element}\footnote{Footnotes are notes placed at the bottom of a page. They cite references or comment on a designated part of the text above it. For example, say you want to add an interesting comment to a sentence you have written, but the comment is not directly related to the argument of your paragraph. } and this \textbf{element}\footnote{Footnotes are not just for interesting comments, however. Sometimes they simply refer to relevant sources -- they let your reader know where certain material came from, or where they can look for other sources on the subject.} provide a footnote.
\end{frame}
